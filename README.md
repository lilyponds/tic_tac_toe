# tic_tac_toe
Ruby Project for Tic Tac Toe

Approach - 

Step 1 - Write Code to create a grid, and allow user to input grid positions to populate a mark on the grid. 
Step 2 - Same as step 1 but add abilitiy for two different marks to be entered alternately 
Step 3 - Step 2 + Add ability to check for 3 in a row to decide a winner
Step 4 - Consolidate all of that with giving player names and randomizing 0 and X allocation 
Step 5 - + Allowing to decide the number of games played and keeping score 
Step 6 - + Allowing to decide the size of the grid itself

Introducing OOP and utilizing is as much as I can. 
Trying to run linting and follow good project management.
